\# Results



The simulation was run with 1024 shots.



\## Observed Output

The target state `101` appeared with the highest frequency,

confirming successful amplitude amplification.



\## Interpretation

\- One Grover iteration is sufficient for N=8

\- Non-target states still appear due to quantum probability

\- Repeated runs consistently show the same dominant result



\## Conclusion

Grover’s algorithm demonstrates a quadratic speedup over

classical brute-force search for small search spaces.
