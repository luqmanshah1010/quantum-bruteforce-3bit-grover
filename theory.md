\# Theory: Quantum Brute Force using Grover’s Algorithm



\## Classical Brute Force

A classical computer checks one value at a time.

For 3 bits, this requires up to 8 iterations.



\## Quantum Superposition

3 qubits can represent all 8 states simultaneously.



\## Oracle

The oracle marks the correct solution by flipping its phase

without revealing its position.



\## Diffusion Operator

This reflects all amplitudes about their average,

amplifying the marked state.



\## Measurement

After amplification, measuring the qubits yields the correct

solution with high probability.



\## Complexity

Classical: O(N)

Quantum (Grover): O(√N)
